- Make a coffee, this may take a while.  
- If you run the script again, you should probably delete the previous assets created. 
-  Artboard size must be exactly 256px x 256px. 
- Guides must be on a layer called exactly 'Guides (DO NOT MOVE)'. 
- Make sure there are no spaces in the layer names, use hyphens(-) instead.  
- Make sure all layers and sublayers are invisible and unlocked to avoid bugs. <path>s (sub sub sub layers) should remain visible though in layers panel(this is standard). 
- Make sure all icons are on sublayers inside the layer called 'icons' with correct naming. Make sure all colors are on sublayers inside the layer called 'colors' with correct naming. 
- Exported assets will be saved where the .ai file is saved.
